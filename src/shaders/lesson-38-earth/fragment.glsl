    // Cloud
    // How to make clouds 
    // 1. adding the clouds on a sphere on top of the actual earth, which enables some flexibility like rotating the clouds independently.
    //    Unfortunately, rotating the clouds as a full mesh doesnâ€™t look very good and we would need to make the sphere slightly bigger to prevent z-fighting which can look a bit weird.
    // 2. add Perlin noise and animate, which is pretty complex
    // 3. add the clouds directly in the shader and not animate them  <------ we will do this


    // Specular cloud color
    vec2 specularCloudColor = texture(uSpecularCloudsTexture, vUv).rg; 
    float cloudsMix = specularCloudColor.g;
    // to reduce the amount of the cloud, we will use smoothstep
    cloudsMix = smoothstep(0.4, 1.0, cloudsMix);

    // change cloud based on the day/night
    // option 1: make cloud darker at night, white at the day
    float cloudColor = smoothstep(-0.1, 1.0, dayMix); 
    vec3 cloud = mix(color, vec3(cloudColor), cloudsMix); // if cloudsMix is 1, it takes vec3(1, 1, 1) (white);
   
    // option 2: remove cloud at night
    // cloudsMix *= dayMix;
    // vec3 cloud = mix(color, vec3(1.0), cloudsMix);

    color = cloud;

    // Final color
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
