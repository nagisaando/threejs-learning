    // To calculate the view direction, we need the vector from the cameraPosition, to the vPosition.
    // Calculating the vector between two vectors is as simple as subtracting the destination from the origin: (src/assets/lesson-35/view-direction-calculation.png)

    // [Problem with using normal attribute] 
    // normal is facing upwards, resulting the wave color being green
    // and ignoring the shape of the wave
    // src/assets/lesson-36/normal-issue.png
    // this is happening because it is plane geometry and the normal does not care about the updated vertices from vertex shader
    // gl_FragColor = vec4(normal, 1.0);  => rgb(0, 1, 0) => xyz(0, 1, 0)
    // we can not just update the normal attribute which required to do it each frame and cause big performance issue

    // [Solution => neighbors technique]
    // we can fix by using neighbors technique (in the case of grid, and plane is grid)
    // https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/raging-sea-shading-shaders#theory
    // See the vertex shader's modelPositionA and modelPositionB for the implementation 
    
    // 1. we ignore the normal attribute sent with the geometry
    // 2. instead, we are going to compute the theoretical position of neighbours to calculate the normal
    // [compute the theoretical position of neighbours to calculate the normal]
    // 1. get two points based on the vertex (our neighbour will be further away on the x axis (A) and another on z axis (B) (these are theoretical) src/assets/lesson-36/neighbours.png)
    // 2. then update the elevation of those neighbours exactly like we did for the current vertex (wave) src/assets/lesson-36/update-elevation.png
    // 3. we calculate a vector going from the vertex to the A (toA), then vector going from the vertex to B (toB) (src/assets/lesson-36/vector-to-neighbour.png)
    // 4. our computed normal should be the vector perpendicular to both toA and toB and we can do so with the function called "cross product" (src/assets/lesson-36/computed-normal.png)
    // NOTE: in the reference image, toB is positioned in positive Z axes but it is important to put it in NEGATIVE Z AXES!!!
