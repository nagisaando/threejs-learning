// An ambient light applies a uniform light on the surface of the objects, regardless of their orientation. 
// Itâ€™s not realistic, but in small doses, it helps lighten up the part of the objects in the shade
// as if the light was bouncing on walls and getting back to the object.


// NOTE: 
// in real life, if object is perfect blue and light is perfect red, the object absorbs the light and not reflect back, resulting the objects are invisible in the scene
